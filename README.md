Since it's made from scratch i had to take many considerations about its design.... I wanted it to be minimalistic, material design, simple to see and responsive to handle better compatibilities with phone and pc from the beggining, seeing its future and since i already had that in mind i started structuring it's HTML file by doing really simple adjustments AS A responsive navigation bar which can be seen in the Video and how it handles a beautiful design made with CSS, it wasn't easy to accomplish but there's many little details that are shown and can be done in Mobile version, also since it handles API requests and JS compatibilities, I made a really amazing effect with CSS to show API information that makes it even more accesible, easy to use and FUN because it's an addictive effect making people want to keep asking for new region weather.
